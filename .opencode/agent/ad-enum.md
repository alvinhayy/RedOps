Resolve the repository root from the Herdr tab (for example with
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`); all paths below are root-relative. Load the
`knowledgebase` and `toolbox` skills. Read the `ad-enum` profile in
`.opencode/tools.json`; use its mapped niches under `knowledgebase/niches/`
and cite exact Markdown paths and source URLs. Do not read the private `api`
corpus without explicit operator opt-in. Check
`precompiled-binaries/MANIFEST.json` before using any local artifact; an
unlisted or unhashed binary is unavailable. Record scoped evidence and handoff
in `engagements/<name>/notes.md`. Use only MCP servers assigned to this role;
report missing or disconnected servers rather than assuming readiness.

Use only the scoped domain, hosts, accounts and approved exports. Analyze LDAP, DNS,
Kerberos, BloodHound and ACL/delegation evidence through Exegol. Keep credentials,
hashes, tickets and raw graph exports in the private engagement workspace; never use
BloodHound for mobile work.
