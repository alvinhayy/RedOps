  <!--
  The basic idea is to create a post with a lot of images which send request to "/" to block server-side nodejs event loop.
  If images are loading, the request to "/" is slower, otherwise faster.
  By using a well-crafted height, we can let note with "A" load image but note with "Z" not load.
  We can use fetch to measure the request time.

## Practical caveats

This trick is **fragile** and needs to be **calibrated per environment**:

- The **lazy-loading distance threshold** is browser-dependent and can change with browser version, connection type, and headless/headful mode. Chromium loads off-screen images**before** they are visible, so the right`<canvas height>` is usually found empirically. Also note that modern Chromium reduced some native lazy-loading thresholds (for example, roughly`1250px` on 4G and`2500px` on slower links), so older writeups that relied on`3000px+` margins can over-estimate current behavior.<sup>[\[3\]](#references)[\[4\]](#references)</sup>
- In practice, **headless Chromium** can require a**different threshold** than a normal browser. In the original writeup, a value that worked locally (`1850px` ) had to be increased for the remote headless bot (`3350px` ).<sup>[\[2\]](#references)</sup>
- Native `loading="lazy"` is only**deferred when JavaScript is enabled** , so this specific oracle can disappear if the browser disables JS or changes lazy-loading behavior for privacy reasons.<sup>[\[3\]](#references)</sup>
- Give the lazy images an explicit **size** (or place them inside a container with deterministic dimensions) while calibrating the oracle. Browsers can treat unspecified images as`0x0` , decide that they already fit in the viewport, and eagerly fetch**all** of them, destroying the signal.<sup>[\[4\]](#references)</sup>
- If the image response is **cacheable** , later probes become noisy or useless because the browser may satisfy the request from cache. This is why cache-busting parameters or`Cache-Control: no-store` matter a lot when testing this technique.

## Reliability notes

Compared to the related [connection pool example](connection-pool-example.html), this variant does **not** need an external image callback. It only needs a measurable slowdown. That slowdown can come from:

- **Server-side event-loop blocking** , such as many image requests hitting a Node.js endpoint that performs synchronous work.
- **Socket / connection contention** , where the attacker saturates available connections and times how long an additional request takes.

To make the oracle more stable:

- Use **multiple lazy images** instead of one.
- Add a **cache-buster** to every image URL.
- Measure **several requests** and compare an**average/median** instead of trusting a single sample.
- Recalculate the **canvas height threshold** against the same browser family and execution mode used by the victim bot.
- If `performance.now()` is too noisy, fall back to another**clock** (`requestAnimationFrame` ,`MessageChannel` , or even`PerformanceObserver` watching`longtask` entries) and only classify runs when the slowdown is well above the browser’s timer jitter.
- The same **visibility-gated fetch** idea can be generalized beyond a plain lazy`<img>` . Recent research shows equivalent Boolean oracles built from nested`<object>` /`<iframe srcdoc>` trees and**responsive images** (`srcset` +`sizes` ). If those conditional subresource loads are same-origin or callback-based, they can still be converted into the exact same contention/timing oracle described here.<sup>[\[5\]](#references)</sup>

For more timing-based leak primitives, also check:

[performance.now + Force heavy task](performance.now-+-force-heavy-task.html)

Warning

Some privacy-focused defenses can break the “load only after a browser-driven scroll/viewport change” assumption. For example, XS-Leaks wiki documents `Document-Policy: force-load-at-top` as a way to disable load-on-scroll behaviors such as Scroll-to-Text navigation, which can also reduce similar viewport-based oracles.
